# AXIS - Constitutional Ground

> **FROZEN.** These documents define ENOQ's identity and cannot be modified.

## Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [AXIOMS.md](./AXIOMS.md) | 12 infinite priors (what ENOQ IS) |
| [INVARIANTS.md](./INVARIANTS.md) | 11 structural constraints (what MUST hold) |
| [RUBICON.md](./RUBICON.md) | Existential threshold specification |
| [HASH_FREEZE.md](./HASH_FREEZE.md) | Cryptographic verification of freeze |

## Verification

```bash
# Verify AXIS integrity
sha256sum AXIS/*.md
# Compare against HASH_FREEZE.md
```

## Key Invariants

- **INV-003**: No normative delegation (never tell user what to do)
- **INV-009**: Rubicon protection (identity/meaning are sacred)
- **INV-011**: No diagnosis (never label user's condition)

## Philosophy

AXIS is the constitutional layer - not code, but law. These documents define what ENOQ **is** at its deepest level. The implementation (src/) exists to serve these truths.

*"The code serves the constitution, never the reverse."*
