# ENOQ MODES AND ATMOSPHERES

## Clarifying the Two Systems

---

## The Question

ENOQ documentation references two different systems:

1. **Three Modes** (SYSTEM_PROMPT): REGULATE, EXPAND, CONTRACT
2. **Five Atmospheres** (ENOQ_INTERFACE): OPERATIONAL, HUMAN_FIELD, DECISION, V_MODE, EMERGENCY

How do these relate?

---

## The Answer

They are **two different dimensions** of the same system.

### Atmospheres = WHERE (Domain)

Atmospheres describe **what kind of situation** is happening:

| Atmosphere | Domain |
|------------|--------|
| OPERATIONAL | Task completion |
| HUMAN_FIELD | Emotional presence |
| DECISION | Choice mapping |
| V_MODE | Deep reflection |
| EMERGENCY | Crisis containment |

### Modes = HOW (Operation)

Modes describe **what operation** is needed:

| Mode | When | Operation |
|------|------|-----------|
| REGULATE | Dysregulated | Slow, ground, contain |
| EXPAND | Too closed | Open, question, widen |
| CONTRACT | Too open | Crystallize, name, close |

---

## How They Combine

Modes operate **within** atmospheres.

| Atmosphere | REGULATE | EXPAND | CONTRACT |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| OPERATIONAL | Slow down, one step at a time | Show options | Pick one, execute |
| HUMAN_FIELD | Ground, presence | What else is there? | What's the core feeling? |
| DECISION | Contain overwhelm | Map all options | Name the real choice |
| V_MODE | (rare - V_MODE is already slow) | What are you not seeing? | What do you see now? |
| EMERGENCY | Primary mode | (rarely used) | (rarely used) |

## Examples

### OPERATIONAL + CONTRACT
User is exploring many ways to write their email, going in circles.
- Atmosphere: OPERATIONAL (it's a task)
- Mode: CONTRACT (they need to pick one and finish)

### HUMAN_FIELD + REGULATE
User is overwhelmed with anxiety about a relationship.
- Atmosphere: HUMAN_FIELD (emotional content)
- Mode: REGULATE (they're dysregulated)

### DECISION + EXPAND
User sees only two options in a career decision.
- Atmosphere: DECISION (it's a choice)
- Mode: EXPAND (they're too closed)

### EMERGENCY + REGULATE
User is in crisis, panic.
- Atmosphere: EMERGENCY (safety first)
- Mode: REGULATE (always - ground and contain)

## Detection Flow

```
1. DETECT DOMAIN → Which atmosphere?
   ├── Task? → OPERATIONAL
   ├── Emotion? → HUMAN_FIELD
   ├── Choice? → DECISION
   ├── Meaning/identity? → V_MODE
   └── Crisis? → EMERGENCY

2. DETECT STATE → Which mode?
   ├── Dysregulated? → REGULATE
   ├── Stuck/closed? → EXPAND
   └── Looping/open? → CONTRACT

3. RESPOND → Atmosphere shapes FEEL, Mode shapes ACTION
```

## Implementation

### For Interface (Atmospheres)
- Background color
- Spacing
- Component visibility
- Response timing

### For Response (Modes)
- Response length
- Question vs statement
- Opening vs closing
- Pace

---

## Summary

**Atmosphere** = The room you're in (WHAT domain)
**Mode** = What you do in that room (HOW to help)

Both are detected. Both inform the response.
Neither replaces the other.
